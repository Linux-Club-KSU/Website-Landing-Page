<div class="title">Welcome to the Linux Club at Kennesaw State University!</div>

<h2>Our Goal:</h2> <br>
  <!--Statement from club constitution--> We strive to inform and assist 
  anyone interested in making the switch to Linux. Whether it be though attending our 
  weekly meetings or just visiting our wiki, we intend to help anyone interested in using 
  their computer in a faster, safer, and more private way!

<h2>Our Meetings:</h2> <br>
  <!--Statement about meeting structure--> At our weekly meetings, we alternate between 
  topic and "project" meetings. For example, one week we spend time to activly
  discuss a current topic impacting the Linux community, and other weeks 
  we tinker with computers the club has access to. For more information on the current 
  semester's schedule, visit the events tab at the top.

<h2>How to Reach Us:</h2> <br>
  <!--Guide to links, encourage Discord--> On our links tab at the top, we have 
  a few ways to contact us. The best way is through our discord, there we 
  have multiple chatrooms ready to answer any questions you may have.
