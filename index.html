<h2>Our Goal:</h2>
    <body>
            Our mission is to encourage an understanding of Linux operating systems at KSU. 
            Every week, we host meetings where members discuss and collaborate on a variety of topics
            in the field. Anyone is welcome to join, and we even supply our own hardware,
            so no need to worry about breaking something.
