      <div class="div4"><h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Linux Club at Kennesaw State University (LCKSU) is commited to being a beacon of linux information, for experienced and unexperienced members to share, collaborate, and further expand their knowledge of Linux 
      and UNIX-adjacent operating systems. Founded in the fall of 2024 LCKSU has obtained well over 100 members across our various platforms and has built a strong community fostering collaboration within the Linux community here. 
      </p>
      <p>We meet weekly every friday starting on January 23 this year, from 4PM well into the evening, covering a range of topics from customization to installing from scratch. No matter your skill level there are plenty of members 
      who are eager to assist you in whatever Linux project you are interested in. Don't have a computer to spare? No Worries! we have a collection of computers and hardware so that you can "break" our stuff, not yours.</p>
      
      <h2>How to Join</h2>
      <p>The best way to join the LCKSU community is by using the link to our discord. If you want to help contribute to our projects, or even suggest your own, check out our Github and consult our officer team for an invitation.
      If you have any questions, feel free to reach out through a coresponding text chat channel in our discord for a member to respond.
      </p>
      <h2>Meeting Structure</h2>
      <p>Every week we will begin meetings with topic where we discuss a certain, more focused, aspect of linux. After about 30 minutes we break up and work on individual projects or classwork. Feel free to request your own member topic
      or even just work on a personal project.
